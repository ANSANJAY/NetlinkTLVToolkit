# 📝 TLV (Type-Length-Value) - Deep Dive for Interview Revision 🚀

## 📌 Introduction:
- **TLV**: Stands for **Type**, **Length**, and **Value**.
- Purpose: A flexible mechanism to package and send data.

## 🎯 Benefits of TLV:
- ✅ Flexible data packaging
- ✅ Simplifies addition or removal of data
- ✅ No need for extra key structures in programs
- ✅ Receivers can ignore unknown data
- ✅ Receivers can selectively process known data

## 🖼️ TLV Visualization:
- Think of multiple TLVs packed sequentially: TLV1 ➡ TLV2 ➡ TLV3...
- Each TLV is divided into:
  - **Type** (1 byte): Identifies the nature of the data.
  - **Length** (1 byte): Indicates the length of the 'Value' part.
  - **Value**: The actual data (variable length).
  
## 🔍 Example Explained:
- The given example had 3 TLVs: 
  - **TLV1**: "Abhishek Sagar" (32 bytes)
  - **TLV2**: Not specified (64 bytes)
  - **TLV3**: Not specified (8 bytes)
- TLV type range: 0-255 (due to 1-byte limit)
- TLV length indicates the length of the value.

## 🚀 TLV Types & Their Significance:
- A TLV type (like 1, 2, or 3) offers two kinds of information:
  1. **Data Type**: What kind of data is in the value? (String, Integer, Float, etc.)
  2. **Data Unit Length**: Size of a single unit of data in the 'Value' part.

## 📊 TLV Overhead:
- Comprises the Type and Length bytes.
- Total size: 2 bytes (constant).
- Often termed as "TLV overhead".

## 📌 Note:
- Stay tuned for the next lesson where we'll delve deeper into TLVs using another example.

## 🤔 Interview Questions about TLV:

1. **Question**: What does TLV stand for, and what's its purpose?
   
   **Answer**: TLV stands for Type-Length-Value. It's a mechanism for flexible data packaging and transmission, allowing easy addition/removal of data without needing additional key structures in programs.

2. **Question**: How can you describe the structure of a typical TLV?

   **Answer**: A typical TLV has three parts: Type (1 byte), Length (1 byte), and Value (variable size). The type identifies the nature of the data, the length indicates the size of the value, and the value holds the actual data.

3. **Question**: What do you understand by "TLV Overhead"?

   **Answer**: TLV Overhead refers to the combined size of the Type and Length fields in a TLV. It is always constant, totaling 2 bytes.

4. **Question**: How does the TLV type benefit the recipient machine?

   **Answer**: The TLV type provides two key pieces of information: the data type present in the value (string, integer, float, etc.) and the length of one unit of this data. This enables the recipient to selectively process recognized data and ignore unknown data.
