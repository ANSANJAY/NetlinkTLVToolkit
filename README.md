# üìö TLVs and Netlink Attributes Repository Overview

## üìå Introduction to TLVs (Type-Length-Value)
The TLV (Type-Length-Value) format is a popular method for optional information encoding in many protocols and data structures. This triad format consists of:
1. **Type**: An identifier that describes the kind of value.
2. **Length**: The size of the value part, often denoted in bytes.
3. **Value**: The actual data.

TLVs provide a flexible and extensible method to convey data. The recipient can quickly understand and parse the data, and if it encounters an unknown type, it can skip the section and continue processing the subsequent TLVs. This makes the TLV format a preferred choice for many applications ranging from telecommunications protocols to configuration data storage.
